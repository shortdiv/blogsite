Hello, my name is Divya. I'm a developer with a passion for the web and all things Open Source. I used to spend a large portion of my time on the fullstack side of things with a frontend leaning. But as of the last 2.5 years, I have moved further back in the stack, sometimes even touching the deep cold heart of the barest of metals. That transition has been both delightfully interesting and incredibly intimidating to say the least.

Currently, I'm a platform/fullstack engineer at [Fly.io](https://fly.io)
where I work on making the platform better for users. I've found a niche for myself in devtools and I've enjoyed improving the overall user experience there. In my free time, I'm an avid rock climber and
cyclist.

I'm not looking for a new position at the moment. However, if you want to talk
shop or chat about rock climbing or bicycles, hit me up at **_hello [at]
