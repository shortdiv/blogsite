Hello, my name is Divya. I'm a developer with a passion for the web and all things Open Source. I used to spend a large portion of my time on the fullstack side of things with a frontend leaning. As of the last few years, I've moved farther back in the stack, where I sometimes get to touch and—on many an (accidental) occasion—break the hearts of the coldest and barest of metals. This transition has been both delightfully interesting and chillingly intimidating to say the least.

I'm a platform engineer who has spent the last few years working at some really cool companies like Netlify and Fly.io. I've found a niche for myself in devtools over the years and now enjoy thinking about improving the UX of systems. In the free time that I have, I'm a serial hobbyist with a penchant for climbing rocks and riding bicycles.

I'm not looking for a new position at the moment. However, if you want to talk shop or chat about rock climbing or bicycles, hit me up at **_hello[at]shortdiv[dot]com_**
