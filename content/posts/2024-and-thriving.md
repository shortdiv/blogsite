2024 was the year when I finally transitioned from surviving to thriving. With everything that transpired over the last few years, I got lost in the chaos of my reality and it's taken me a second to "get back". I'm not quite who I used to be, but I've become a version of myself that I'm quite pleased with, same same but different.

The year came and went, for the most part, without incident. And (for once) I have no one to blame but myself for any and all shenanigans I found myself in. I grew, I learnt, and successfully averted any major crisis. In no specific order, here’s everything that happened this year in a nutshell:

- Started experimenting with having an artistic/creative outlet i.e. So far, I’ve worked with metal, glass, acrylic and wood
- Moved cities
- Finalized my immigration paperwork and secured a permanent greencard
- Moved in with roommates after ~10 years of living alone
- Embarked on a 12 week sabbatical at Recurse Center
- Travelled to 2 new countries, Brazil, and Taiwan; and almost got robbed+kidnapped in one
- Planned and executed my first bike packing trip in Taiwan
- Broke my nose while learning to surf
- Helped a friend execute an engagement!
- Rode the Zephyr from Chicago to California (50 hours!)
- Participated in my first (outdoor) bouldering comp
- Gave a talk at Elixir Conf
- Got laid off

In short, 2024 has been a year of growth, reflection, and self-discovery. Some losses, many wins. As cliched as it may sound, I wouldn't be here were it not for the low lows of the prior few years. And I can't wait to see what 2025 has in store.
