Standing at the end of another year, I couldn’t have possibly imagined what this year would hold. I think I can safely and with absolute certainty say that this year has never been and will never be like any other. While my professional life continued to prosper, 2021 has been a year of immense personal sadness.

I lost a parent during the course of my mandatory quarantine and had to grieve alone. Then, in the blur of navigating the endless paperwork that often follows death, the man who promised to be there (till death do us part) walked out on me; leaving me to handle yet another pile of paperwork alone. And since nothing sparked joy, I marie kondo-ed the life I once had and have been on the move ever since; my eat pray love journey as I like to jokingly call it.

I don't recount this expecting pity, or praise. I recount this, to remember that this year, I survived. So often we're quick to calculate our professional and life achievements without taking into account the values, virtues and important lessons we've learnt along the way.

They say what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. I don’t believe I’m any stronger or better for what happened this year. Though I’m a lot more empathetic and humble than I was a year ago. Nothing is promised, nothing is guaranteed. I now take life a little less seriously, maybe this is a good thing.

In light of this year’s events, I’m hesitant to set a resolution for 2022. But as I look forward into a new year, I hope for a calmer year, one where growth and personal development isn’t quite as painful. I can only hope the same for you.
