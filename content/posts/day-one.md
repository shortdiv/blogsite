Today was a really hard day. I lost the man who raised me. The man who was there for all my milestones. We didn't always agree but he had a heart of gold and was always there for his family, his friends, his neighborhood, his community.

Words canâ€™t begin to express the immense grief I feel. The grief I feel as I process this loss alone from the confines of a hotel room 5 miles away, 3 days shy of being released from quarantine, devoid of the ability to hug and be hugged. I'm not sure what the next few days or even weeks are going to look like, but I do know that I'll get through this, eventually. But safe to say, that I'm not going to be ok for a bit. </3
