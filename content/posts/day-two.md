I got approval to leave quarantine to attend the funeral. Singapore has a thing called visits on compassionate grounds, which requires a negative covid test and special arrangements to be escorted to the location. I won’t be able to hug anyone or touch anyone but I’ll be able to say goodbye. I pushed to be includedd in the ceremonies, which are usually only reserved for men, and I’m really happy that I get to do that. I’m really scared, but I’m going to try to stay strong for my family.
